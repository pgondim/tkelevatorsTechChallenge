# CI/CD - Pipeline - GitHub actions
A CICD pipeline was created with github actions to run cypress tests automatically with each new push made to the project.

To access the pipelines that have already been executed, simply go to the project's [Actions](https://github.com/pgondim/tkelevatorsTechChallenge/actions) tab.
